    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
      I always wanted to learn something about computers but i didn't really had
      a chance to do it unfortunately. 3 years ago o tried a bootcamp prep
      course and i really enjoyed it, right now i go to an IT college twice a
      week after the work, i'm kinda tired tbh, and i also started an udemy
      course it is called: The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp.
